  "description" : "[h1]Current release title: 1st Year of Dev![/h1]\n[b]Release version: 0.6.1.1[/b]\n\nREAD CAREFULLY BEFORE SUBSCRIBING! YOU WILL NEED UMBRAL COALITION TO PLAY WITH THIS VERSION OF GFOW! The standalone is available, but will not be updated for compatibility reasons. \n-->YOU WILL NEED NEW CHARACTERS WITH GFOW V0.6+!<-- \nUsing older characters will result in a crash or otherwise irreversible damage. If you are not sure, please, back up your saves!\n\nGFOW is a side-project that adds fan-made content to UC. Specifically, from day one, this mod has always been a playable Webber mod. \n\n YOU MUST INSTALL A CHARACTER SELECTION SCREEN EXTENDER (To select the added species), and it is recommended to use Ztarbound or Frackin' Universe for the change logs (ZB/FU is not required). I recommend the extender shown in the required items. This mod will work without the character extender, but you can't play as the races included in this mod. YOU WILL NEED UMBRAL COALTION FOR THIS MOD.\n\nReport bugs to the [i]official GitHub page @ https://github.com/Vetpetmon-Labs/Starbound---Webbers with your starbound.log.[/i] I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HELP YOU IF YOU DO NOT SEND THE LOG IN THE GITHUB ISSUES PAGE.\n\n[h1]WHAT DOES THIS MOD DO?[/h1]\n\n This Starbound mod adds in 2 species and weapons for them. A few rare structures may spawn!\n\nThink GFOW/UC is missing something? You can contribute to the mod(s) on GitHub!\n\n[b]NOTES:[/b]\n\nUmbral Coalition: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1545786562\n\nJoin the Umbral Coaltion Discord for news, the dev log, and more! There's a bug-reports channel for those who don't have a GitHub account, and you can contribute: https://discord.gg/wqKXbCA\n\n [i]I DO NOT OWN ANY IP IN THIS MOD (if applicable), some of the IP belongs to the respective owners. This is just a fan work with some original concepts in the mix. Please check credits.txt on the GitHub repo or in the mod's Ztarbound update panel.[/i]",
